### Using Python and BeautifulSoup to webscrape the first 10,000 movie titles from each genre on the IMDb website

#### In the first notebook, I use 'Action' as an example to show how I scrape each movie's information and create a dataframe out of it

#### Once I create a notebook for every genre, I run them all from the 'Master' notebook to create a single dataframe that contains every genre

#### Third, I create the 'Main' notebook to run the entire 'Master' notebook. From the 'Main' notebook, I can update every genre in the dataframe just by running it

#### Lastly, I use the 'Database' notebook to export the cleaned dataframe into a SQL database
